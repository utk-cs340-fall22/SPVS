* Background
There is a cyberattack every 39 seconds! In today's day and age, security is such an important issue
and people would like the best protection against these crimes. To ensure that their computer is in
safe hands and to check and see if there are any existing vulnerabilites on their computer, SPVS is
a simplified port and vulnerability scanner which checks for any ports on your computer that might have 
any kinds of vulnerabilities. This software is easy to use and has a user-friendly front-end, which
makes it a great tool to use.


* Product Overview
Simple Port and Vulnerability Scanner (SPVS) is an easy-to-use network scanner.
There are two ways in which you can use the tool and they are: through command line or through web. There are
multiple ways in which scanning can take place. There is a default scanning option which only scans the 1000
most common ports. Another option is that users can scan an individual port or IP address as well as a range of
ports or IP addresses. The user can also provide a file with IP addresses that that they would like to be
scanned; this is particularly useful when you have many addresses. After taking in all the required info, the
tool scans the addresses and ports, and the tool will display information such as the status of the
target, open/close ports, and their known vulnerabilities.
