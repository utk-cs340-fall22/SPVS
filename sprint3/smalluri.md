# Sprint 3

Group Name: SPVS

## What you planned to do
I planned to modify my current simple port scanner that will now scan multiple addresses at a time as well as produce output by those scans much faster than the previous sprints. I also added a default scan option, where the user's computer is scanned for the first 100 ports. Here are the issues that I worked on:

- Default Scan (Issue #31) (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/31)
- Scanning multiple addresses (Issue #22) (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/22)
- Add "fast mode" for port scanning (Issue #10) (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/10)

## What you did not do
- I worked on and completed all the issues that I was assigned

## What problems you encountered
The only problem that I encountered during sprint 3 was the way that I was "building my program" and had to use an application called CMake to fix this issue

## Issues you worked on
- [#31] (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/31)
- [#22] (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/22)
- [#10] (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/10)


## Files you worked on
- spvs/spvs_cli/src/simple_scanner.cpp

## What you accomplished
In sprint 3, I modfified my port scanner with a couple more features than before, which will serve as a great place for the next sprint. The features that I added are: scanning for multiple addresses, adding a defualt scan option, and producing output from scans much faster.
