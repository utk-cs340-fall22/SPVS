# Sprint 3

Name: Ankit Mistry, GitHub ID: ankitm28, Group Name: SPVS

### What you planned to do
* Adding feature to scan targets of the host
* Add an option to download results.txt file from the web app
* Format the output displayed on the web app

### What you did not do
* Add an option to download results.txt file from the web app
* Format the output displayed on the web app

### What problems you encountered
I was unable to work on my intended goal since the front end was not properly working with the backend.

### Files you worked on
spvs/spvs_cli/port_scanner.cpp

### What you accomplished
I was able to accomplish adding a feature of scanning the targets on the host machine whose IP address or web address was passed in. I wasn't able to do much of what I intended to do, since the frontend (web app) and the backend (the tool) were connected and working properly by the near end of the sprint.
