# Sprint 3

* netid - cblank10
* github id - codyb42
* Group name - SPVS
* name - Cody Blankenship


### What you planned to do
* Add error checking
* Run and return output from tool
* Add flags to frontend

### What you did not do
* File upload didn't get finished, and, even though it was low priority, we said we would finish it.

### What problems you encountered
Again, I struggled with windows compability before giving up and switching to linux. This finally fixed the problem thankful. I also had to merge changes that Shivam made to be coherent. This was a more difficult exercise than I expected.

### Issues you worked on
* [35](https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/35) TOOL & WEB: Link front and backends
* [32](https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/32) WEB: Make frontend and backend interactive
* [8](https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues) TOOL: Implement port scanning for a range of ports specified on cmd (I should have made a second issue, but I just piggy-backed this one for our front end)

### What you accomplished
This was a big sprint for us. We officially are running the app and returning data to the frontend. The UI is now running smoothly(it could look better but that is what is coming next!). Overall, our concern for this sprint was functionality not beauty, and we achieved that. We know have frontend end error checking, optional flags, and returned data.

This sets us up perfectly coming in to the last sprint(at least my job), to focus almost purely on the cosmetics. Some big points include, a help tab, improved loading screen, output download, and output formatting. Very excited to present our work!
