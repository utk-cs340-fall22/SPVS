# Sprint 2

Name: Ankit Mistry, GitHub ID: ankitm28, Group Name: SPVS

### What you planned to do
* Create a LAB of 3-5 virtual machines to test our port scanner.
* Implement a function to scan a range of IP addresses.
* Implement code on a default scan if no arguments are supplied.

### What you did not do
* Implement function to scan a range of IP addresses.
* Implement code to a default scan if no arguments are supplied

### Issues you worked on
[#1](https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/4) Setup 3-5 Virtual Machines

### Problems you have encountered
I encountered problems on figuring out how to implement multi-threading in my port scanner. I spent too much 
time on learning about how multi-threading works therefore could not work on it.

### Files you worked on
spvs/spvs_cli/port_scanner.cpp

### What you accomplished
Until yet, I have accomplished basic port scanning on other IP addresses rather than scannning my own system. 
It also reads input from files and then scans the hosts read in from the file.
