# Sprint 2
Mason Hyman - Github ID: masonhyman-school - SPVS

## What you planned to do:
For sprint 2, I planned to organize the backend tool code that already existed and vastly flesh out many of its features. I also planned to add efficient multithreaded functionality to the port scanner. Below is a list of features worked on and their github issues:

* Implement Better Functioning Argument Parser: [Issue #28](https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/28)
* Add multithreaded functionality to port scanning: [Issue #21](https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/21)
* Add "default" scan mode: [Issue #](https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/10)
* Add user specified port range scannign: [Issue #27](https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/27)
* Refactor file support for target specification: [Issue #29](https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/29)
* Refactor port fingerprinting w/ reference db: [Issue #20](https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/20)
* Modularize and refactor code base + documentation: [Issue: #30](https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/30)

## What you did not do:
For this sprint I had planned on creating a better system for port-fingerprinting by creating a database of known ports for the tool to reference after scanning. This will be added to the sprint 3 backlog. I also planned to add a "default" scanning mode that gives basic information when no flags are specified.

## What problems you encountered:
Learning about multithreading was my biggest obstacle for this sprint. Researching threads in C++ took much more time than expected because it is a completely new area for me. Modularizing the code base was also a big hassle.

## Issues you worked on:

* [Issue #21](https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/21)
* [Issue #27](https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/27)
* [Issue #28](https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/28)
* [Issue #29](https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/29)
* [Issue: #30](https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/30)

## Files you worked on:

* include/SPVS.h
* src/main.cpp
* Makefile

## What you accomplished:
I feel that this sprint was excellent in terms of progress made. Modularizing the code and refactoring things has increased productity by quite a bit. In addition, by successfully implementing a multithreaded port scanner, I have sped up scanning by a remarkable amount. Before this change, scanning 65535 ports took roughly 30min - 1hr depending on the connection, now it takes at most 8 seconds on slow hosts. This makes the tool far more usuable and is a great step forward.
