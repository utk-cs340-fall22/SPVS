# Sprint 2

## What you planned to do
I planned to modify my current simple port scanner that would take any address as well as give the user the option to scan a range of ports or scan any specififed ports that they want. I also added port descriptions to the most commonly used top ports that were being scanned. Here are the issues that I worked on:

- Implement range of ports (Issue #26) (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/26)
- Add port descriptions for top ports (Issue #20) (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/20)

## What you did not do
- Add "fast mode" for port scanning (Issue #10) (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/10)

## What problems you encountered
The only problem that I encountered during sprint 2 was a "linker" error that had to do with how I was building my program. After rebuilding my SFML library, my code began to run properly.

## Issues you worked on
- [#26] (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/26)
- [#20] (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/20)

## Files you worked on
- spvs/spvs_cli/src/simple_scanner.cpp

## What you accomplished
In sprint 2, I created a port scanner that will serve as a great place for the next sprint. The features that I added are: scanning a range of ports and adding port descriptions to the most commonly used top ports that were being scanned
