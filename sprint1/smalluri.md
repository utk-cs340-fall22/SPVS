# Sprint 1

## What you planned to do
I planned to create a simple port scanner that would take any address as well as any list of port numbers as arguments and see whether each port is open or closed for the specified address. This simple port scanner is to serve as a foundation for the next sprint and build upon it. Here are the issues that I worked on:

- Host discovery for a single host passed on argv (Issue #2) (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/2)
- Add port scan functionality for one port (Issue #7) (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/7)

## What you did not do
- Implement range-based port scanning (Issue #8) (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/8)

## What problems you encountered
The only problem that I encountered during sprint 1 was connecting my source files to the SFML Library. After modifying a couple of things in the MAKEFILE, my code began to run properly.

## Issues you worked on
- [#2] (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/2)
- [#7] (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/7)

## Files you worked on
- spvs/spvs_cli/src/simple_scanner.cpp

## What you accomplished
In sprint 1, I created a simple port scanner that will serve as a strong foundation for future sprints. The features that I added are: scanning for any address and adding port scan functionality for any port.
