# Sprint 1

Name: Mason Hyman 
Github ID: masonhyman-school
Group Name: SPVS

### What you planned to do
In sprint 1, I planned to develop a foundation for the backend of our project. My main goal was to create a working port-scanner by the end of sprint 1. Listed below are some of the basic functionalities and issues associated with creating a port scanner:

* Host discovery for a single host passed on argv (Issue #2) (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/2)
* Implement host discovery for a list of IP addresses specified from a file (Issue #3) (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/3) 
* Add option to perform port discovery (Issue #5) (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/5)
* Implement and test port scanning for a single port (Issue #7) (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/7)
* Create modular makefile for use with the project (Issue #15) (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/15)
* Build SFML and add to project directory (Issue #16) (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/16)

### What you did not do
* Implement range-based port scanning (Issue #8) (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/8)
* Implement argument parser (Issue #17) (https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/17)

### What problems you encountered
I encountered two major problems during sprint 1. The first being: building and figuring out how to use the SFML Networking library. After a good bit of troubleshooting and realizing their documentation is incorrect, I got basic functionality down. Because the majority of the project is based on many primatives laid out in SFML Networking, some features are slightly behind schedule.

The second problem I encountered, was the speed of the port scanning. Even with a 100ms timeout, scanning all 65,535 takes a long time. It became clear quickly that process needed to threaded.

Create a multithreaded farm for accomplishing port scanning tasks will be a main goal for sprint 2.

### Files you worked on

### What you accomplished
In this sprint, I accomplished a substantial foothold to proceed on for the next sprint. Working port scanning funcionality was key for this sprint, which has been finished. In addition, being able to specify individual hosts and host files is a large accomplishment for this sprint.
