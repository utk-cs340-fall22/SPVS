# Sprint 1

(include your Shivam Mistry, smistry4, SPVS)

### What you planned to do
- brainstorm technologies to build web interface
- make front-end web interface

### What you did not do
- make the front-end web interface functional

### What problems you encountered
Since I was making just the front-end, there were minimal difficulties. The biggest one is understanding how React works with NPM, the part where it creates a local server, and how to run the server to see the output. 

### Issues you worked on
 [#1 https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/1](https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/1) Front-end-No-Functionality

### Files you worked on
- spvs/SpvsWebReact/public/index.html
- spvs/SpvsWebReact/public/styles.css
- spvs/SpvsWebReact/src/components/App.jsx
- spvs/SpvsWebReact/src/components/Header.jsx
- spvs/SpvsWebReact/src/components/Ip.jsx
- spvs/SpvsWebReact/src/index.js

### What you accomplished
Initially, I started learning React, mainly .jsx format, components, and props, and then used that knowledge to set up react project on local machine. Then, I started implementing what I learned to create interface using React components. Finally I added CSS rules to add styling to the webpage.
