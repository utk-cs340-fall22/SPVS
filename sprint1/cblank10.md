### What you planned to do
*  This was my main issue for sprint one: https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/1. We wanted to design and build the front end of the site.
*  In hindsight, we should have made a second issue, but I spent a long time trying to pick a backend and then once node.js was picked trying to understand it enough to begin connecting the two.

### What you did not do
* Connecting the frontend to the backend. Even though it is very close, and wasn't original planned to be finished by sprint 1 we still didn't get it done.

### What problems you encountered
Learning node.js a new framework to me. I also struggled with GitHub pages as I'll touch on later.

### Issues you worked on

### Files you worked on
* /js/script.js
* /css/style.css
* /spvs-high-resolution-logo.png
* /index.html

### What you accomplished
I was able to design a logo and color scheme for the frontend site. I also worked to create the prototype of the frontend, then redesign and improve it visually. This included writing the html and css. I did write some javascript but nothing that got commited yet for sprint 1. Created a functioning form, and tested on a GitHub site. I then spent an unfortunate amount of time trying to see if it was possible to run the whole site through GitHub pages, spoiler alert, it is not. It was then I had to learn alot about node JS. More planning than programming unfortunately but I am still happy with what me and my teamates were able to make on the front end.
