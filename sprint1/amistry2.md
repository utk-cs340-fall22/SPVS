# Sprint 1
Name: Ankit Mistry; Github ID: ankitm28; Group Name: SPVS

### What you planned to do
  * Make a simple port scanner which scans for open ports on the local machine
  * Setup Virtual Machines to test the code on
  * Researching about basic vulnerabilities that an operating system can have.
  

### What you did not do
  * I was not able to get the virtual machines setup.
  * Research about basic vulnerabilities

### What problems you encountered
This sprint was a major rollercoaster for me. First of all, I was sick so I couldn't work on the project as much as I intended. Other than that, I struggled to understand how the SFML library works and how to integrate it into my code, which required special tool called CMake to do that.

### Issues you worked on
  * [[#1] https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/7](https://github.com/masonhyman-school/spvs/issues/7) 

### Files you worked on
  * spvs/spvs_cli/src/port_scanner.cpp

### What you accomplished
The feature I worked on is pretty basic and only does port scanning on my local machine. It takes in the port number and then says whether if it is open or not.
